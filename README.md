### What is this repository for? ###

Welcome! I am finally breaking down and trying to centrally record my recipies. Probably an odd thing to be in GIT but I use it for my day job and it makes sense to me. Anyway, I am making this repository public so that other might gain some enjoyment from these recipes.
