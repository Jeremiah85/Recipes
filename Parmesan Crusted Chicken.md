# Parmesan Crusted Chicken

## Ingredients

* 2 lbs Chicken Breasts
* 1 tbs Olive Oil
* 1 Cup Panko Breadcrumbs
* 4 Chicken Breasts
* 1/3 Cup Mayonnaise
* 2 Large Eggs, Beaten
* 1/2 salt, plus for seasoning chicken
* 1/4 black pepper, plus for seasoning chicken
* 1 & 1/2 cups Grated Parmesan Cheese, Divided
* 1 tsp Garlic Powder

Preheat oven to 425°F and place parchment paper on a baking sheet.

Heat the `Olive Oil` in a frying pan over medium heat.
When shimmering, add the `Panko` and stir constantly until the `Panko`
is a light golden brown.
Transfer to a wide container and set aside to cool.

Flatten each `Chicken Breast` to a thickness of 1/2-inch and then
pat the `Chicken Breasts` dry with paper towels.

Whisk the `Mayonnaise`, `Eggs`, 1/2 cup of the `Parmesan Cheese`,
1/2 Teaspoon `Salt`, and 1/4 Teaspoon `Pepper` in a wide bowl.

Add the remaining 1 cup of `Parmesan Cheese` and the `Garlic Powder` to
the `Panko` and stir lightly to combine.

Season both sides of the `Chicken Breasts` with `Salt` and `Pepper`.
Coat each `Chicken Breast` in the egg mixture and shake gently to
remove the excess.
Cover each `Chicken Breast` completely in the panko mixture,
pressing it on to make sure the panko adheres.
Place `Chicken Breasts` onto the baking sheet and bake until the
internal temperature is 165°F, generally 15 - 20 minutes.
