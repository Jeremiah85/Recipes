## Notes

This is a really flexable recipe and the ingredients are based more
on what I have in my pantry than anything else.
The recipe I started with just had the meat, ketchup, mustard,
and worcestershire sauce; everything else has been added as I go along.
Generally I don't bother measuring anything and I just taste after each
ingredient is added.
